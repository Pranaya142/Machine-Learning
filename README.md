                                                                       Machine Learning Introdution:


Machine learns from Historical Data.


3 Phase:

1.  we need to first Train the machine which is Training phase.
2.  Then we have test the data which is Testin phase.
3.  After that we need to predict in future which is Validaton Phase.
In ML model data is 3 types.
1.  Supervised Data.
   1. Regression model( Dependent Variable is continuous)
      Here we use Regression Algo
   2. Classification model( Dependent Variable is binary(0/1))
      Here we use Classification Algo
2.  Unsupervised Data
   1. Clustering Model( No Dependetn variable(Gruoping))
      Here we use Clustering Algo
3.  Semi Supervised Data.
   combination of both 1 and 2.
ðŸªœ PipeLine:
   1. Gathering a Data
   2. Clean the Data
   3. Choosing a Model
   4. Training
   5. Evaluation
   6. Hyperperameters
   7. Prediction
   8. Ml Lops
For Testing we need to split the data with a ratio.The ration should either (70-30) or (80-20) or (75-25).
