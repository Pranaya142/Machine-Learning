ðŸ¥‘ Avocado dataset used all Regression models to find the best accuracy.

ðŸªœ  pipeline:

          1. Performed cleaning data
          2. Split the data int X and Y variables.
          3. Train and Test the data.
          4. Used all Regression models.
          5. Find Bias, Variance, Accuracy of the y_test and y_pred.

ðŸ“Š Performed EDA techniques and used Scatter plot,Boxen plot to know the outliers ,Count plot to know the count of avocado price per bags.
          
ðŸ§  Techniques used for Model Prediction:

          1. Sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split for training and testing the data.
          2. sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler to scaling the data which is trained and tested.
          3. sklearn.linear_model for  LinearRegression
          4. sklearn.neighbours for KNeighbours.
          5. sklearn.metrics for MSE,R2,MAE.
          6. XGBoost
          7. sklearn.svm for SVR(Support Vector Regression)
